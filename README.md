# Pong Multiplayerv2
A fork of Godot Engine's multiplayer [Pong](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-demo-projects/tree/master/networking/multiplayer_pong) project which I am rewriting to support the TCP protocol.

With that said, I am also adding support for hosting a Linux server for this game.

This project will be used in a demo where I demonstrate a server directory I've been working on for [@modcommunity](https://github.com/modcommunity). For more information on this, please check [this repository](https://github.com/gamemann/tmc-servers-engine) out!
